# ðŸš€ðŸ¦™ LLaMA: Streaming + INT8 edition

> Note: Most of this README comes from [llama-int8](https://github.com/tloen/llama-int8) and the [original LLaMA repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama).

This is a fork of the LLaMA code that runs LLaMA-13B comfortably within 24 GiB of RAM.
It relies almost entirely on the `bitsandbytes` and `LLM.int8()` work of Tim Dettmers.
I've tested it on an RTX 4090, and it [reportedly works on the 3090](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/issues/79#issuecomment-1454687232). It might also theoretically allow us to run LLaMA-65B on an 80GB A100, but I haven't tried this. (edit from @[din0s](https://github.com/din0s): Also tested with 40GB A100, fits 7B without int8, 13B with int8.)

The code contains the following changes (thanks to [shawwn](https://github.com/shawwn/llama) and [tloen](https://github.com/tloen/llama-int8)!):

- Removes parallelism constructs
- Quantizes weights on the host machine
- Loads weights incrementally to avoid severe memory problems
- Added dependencies on `bitsandbytes`, `tqdm`.
- Repetition penalty settings (`--repetition_penalty`, default 1.15)
- Adds option to stream token-by-token when `batch_size` is 1.

On my Ubuntu machine with 64 GB of RAM and an RTX 4090, it takes about 25 seconds to load in the floats and quantize the model.
Users should be ready to expand their swapfiles if they don't have enough RAM.
Llamanon has also produced a [slightly uncouth user's guide](https://rentry.org/llama-tard) for using this repo, which I won't reproduce here but seems generally trustworthy.
[You will likely need to build `bitsandbytes` from source.](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/compile_from_source.md)

# Original README

This repository is intended as a minimal, hackable and readable example to load [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971v1)) models and run inference.
In order to download the checkpoints and tokenizer, fill this [google form](https://forms.gle/jk851eBVbX1m5TAv5)

## Setup

In a conda env with pytorch / cuda available, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then in this repository:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Download

Once your request is approved, you will receive links to download the tokenizer and model files.
Edit the `download.sh` script with the signed url provided in the email to download the model weights and tokenizer.

## Inference

The provided `example.py` can be run on a single or multi-gpu node with `torchrun` and will output completions for two pre-defined prompts. Using `TARGET_FOLDER` as defined in `download.sh`:

```
torchrun --nproc_per_node MP example.py --ckpt_dir $TARGET_FOLDER/model_size --tokenizer_path $TARGET_FOLDER/tokenizer.model
```

Different models require different MP values:

| Model | MP  |
| ----- | --- |
| 7B    | 1   |
| 13B   | 2   |
| 33B   | 4   |
| 65B   | 8   |
